# TOP-Library
This is a Library made for TheOdinProject Course.

# How It's Made:
Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript

I've created this library by creating an array that stores the Book object. Created an eventListener that 
creates the Book Card on click which takes the data from a form.

# Lessons Learned:
Really fun project. Learned how to use objects better and understood them better.
