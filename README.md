# TOP-Library

Welcome to the Enhanced Book Library, a JavaScript library designed to help you manage your reading list. 

This project was created as part of TheOdinProject Course.

# How It's Made

Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript

I've developed this library to offer a more user-friendly and visually appealing experience for book management. Here's how it works:

Interactive Book Cards: Book cards are dynamically created with an event listener, providing an interactive way to input and display book details. The layout is enhanced using Tailwind CSS for a modern look.

# Features

Add Book: Easily add a new book to your reading list by providing the title, author, and number of pages through a visually appealing form.

Edit Book Status: Change the read or unread status of a book directly from the book card.

# How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Start managing your reading list by adding, editing, and marking books as read or unread.

# Lessons Learned
Through this project, I delved deeper into object-oriented programming and gained a better understanding of:

Advanced usage of objects for efficient data management.

Leveraging Tailwind CSS to enhance the visual appeal of web applications.
